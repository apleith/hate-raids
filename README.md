# Hate Raids on Twitch
This is the R code behind my paper, "Couldnâ€™t Protect You: The Cost of (Hate) Raids on Smaller Streamers," which was completed in collaboration with Dr. Rachel Kowert.

## Order of Operation
1. Data Collection
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Analyses
4. Hate Raids


### Data Notes
I have included the created CSV files; however, I have chosen to exclude the raw JSON data pulls used to create those files or that were read back into R. If you run the full code included you will duplicate this data set with whatever tweets remain posted and public.
